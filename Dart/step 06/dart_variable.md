####  Local Variable <br>

*Local variables* are defined in the methods, constructors, or blocks. It is created when we create a method or constructor, and it has scope only inside them. We cannot use a local variable outside the method, constructor, or block.

#### Class Variable <br>

*Class variable* is also known as the static member variable, which is used to declare using the static keyword. It is declared in the class, but outside a constructor, method or a block. All instances share one copy of the class variable or we can say that class variables are common to all instances of that class.

#### Instance Variable <br>

*Instance variable* is also known as the non-static, variable which is used to declare without the static keyword. The instance variables are specific by an object. These variables can be accessed using the instance of that class.
